# PubMed_abstracts

simple script for integrating the abstracts (from txt file) into the csv file after exporting a PubMed search query.
Works best when files are in gdrive, simply copy code to google colab, adjust paths and run.

Important: The data_txt textfile has to be  "PubMed-[..]-set.txt", not "abstract-[...]-set.txt".

Output: csv file with appended column for abstracts
